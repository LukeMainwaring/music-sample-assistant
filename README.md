# Music Sample Assistant

In the music production process, one bottleneck occurs when picking a sound to add, such as a kick, sample loop, synth preset for chords, natural software instrument, etc. Often one just runs through everything downloaded and chooses what sounds nice in the mix. Narrowing down from dozens or more samples is a very tedious process, especially as sample and preset libraries grow. 

Clearly, there are certain sounds that work well in the mix, and itâ€™d be helpful to have a software that filters solid candidate sounds. There are certain frequency clashes, discordant rhythms, and bad harmonics, just to name a few, that will always sound ugly due to our psychoacoustics and cultural musical training. Whether the software simply removes bad sounds or is able to actually rank all candidate sounds, it achieves the same goal of helping you pick your musical selections more quickly and intelligently.

This project aims to assist with sample selection by using a neural network trained on samples that sound well together. For now, it's designed to be used in a web-app format (msa-ui and msa-server).
